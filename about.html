        <p>The Heliotechnics/Heliotechniques Institute for the Study of Solar Practices explores new ways of thinking about energetic entities, such as petroleum, whale oil, electricity, and the sun to decenter anthropocentric representations of nature, culture, and technology. The Institute takes a pluralistic approach to meaning making, providing critical and creative inquiries that pose a very basic question: why do Western humans presume that because energetic entities exist, they should be put to work for human economic productive means?</p>
        <p>The Heliotechnics/Heliotechniques Institute website is a solar powered website. It exists intermittently, in relation to solar activity at the local server site.</p>
        <p>Solar practices explore relations as practices that create alternative conceptualizations of meaning making, knowledge production, media, communication, community, agencies, and beings-together that challenge anthropocentrism. Solar practices does not distinguish between the practices of different entities, and does not assume (Western, English-speaking) human representations are the correct, universal, descriptions of life. Instead, it constructs meaning through relations.</p>
